If we are dealing with big datasets, reading the data in as a table would mean we need to store the entire thing in memory (RAM) - this can be up to 10-20GB which can cripple a normal computer! Instead we use the `DataLoader object` to read in the dataset *as we need it* (and discarding it otherwise). This might be a bit slower, but far more manageable in terms of memory resources.

    "This was something we have previously alluded to, but we have 70,000 labelled examples. Perfect! Do we throw them all into the training/fitting process of the model?\n",

    "\n",
    "![yesbutno](../images/yesbutno.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason lies in a concept known as **overfitting**. Remember, our goal is to make sure the model works well on hiterto unseen data (ie. unlabelled data). If we just throw all the data we have into the train process, then we won't have access to an independent dataset to evaluate the model. Later on, we will see how the test data can be used to assess overfitting. For now, just remember that it is vital that we have an (representative) subset of the labelled data set aside for evaluation. For the purposes of this example, 60,000 images will be used to train and 10,000 images will be used to test:\n",
    "* `Train` -- this is the data we use to fit the model (n=60,000)\n",
    "* `Validate` -- we will not be using this today to tune hyper-parameters\n",
    "* `Test` -- this is the data we use to determine the model performance (n=10,000)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aside: Validate \\& Hyperparameters\n",
    "**Hyperparameters** are parameters of the model that the user has to provide (as opposed to parameters the model finds such as the weights of a neural network). Examples of this might be the learning rate of the gradient descent method (denoted by `lr` later). Since these parameters have to be provided by the user, we need to decide on its value somehow. In the absence of any external information (eg. someone told us a particular learning rate is really good), we use the validate set (independent of train and test) to set these. In the example of learning rate, we may try the learning rate in increments of `0.1` between `0.1` and `0.9`. Then we choose the hyperparameter which gives us the best performance when assessed against the validate set.\n",
    "\n",
    "*For the purpose of this tutorial, we will not do any hyperparameter tuning, so a validate set was not used.*"
