    "### 💪 Part 3: Building and Training Your Model (~30 mins)\n",
    " * Replicate a popular convolutional neural network structure (the LeNet).\n",
    " * Train on a small sample of the data (ie. a single mini-batch).\n",
    " \n",
    "### 🚀 Part 4: To Infinity and Beyond! (~30 mins)\n",
    " * Scale up training to multiple passes of the entire training dataset (epochs).\n",
