    "Welcome! This is part 4 of a 4 part series of neural network learning sessions! Before we begin, to gauge the correct level, here are some of the pre-requisites:\n",
    " * Some familiarity with programming languagues (it doesn't have to be Python, we will be going through some basics here).\n",
    " * Some familiarity with convolutional neural networks (either from the past presentation or otherwise).\n",

    "### üêç Part 1: Exploring Jupyter Notebooks & Python (~30 mins)\n",
    " * Here we learn the basics of using Jupyter Notebooks and Python -- this is essential if you have never used either before.\n",
    " * If you have used both before, feel free to skip this section, but we would still recommend flicking through and making sure you understand what's going!\n",
    " \n",
    "### üèûÔ∏è Part 2: Data Exploration (~30 mins)\n",
    " * Here we will go through a generic version of the data science pipeline.\n",
    " * We will explain the problem statement and the provided data.\n",
    " * We will do some basic exploration and wrangling of the data to prepare for Part 3.\n",
    " \n",
    "### üí™ Part 3: Building and Training Your Model (~30 mins)\n",
    " * We will attempt to reconstruct a particular convolutional neural network architecture (ie. LeNet).\n",
    " * We will train on a small sample of our dataset to ensure the code works.\n",
    " \n",
    "### üöÄ Part 4: To Infinity and Beyond! (~30 mins)\n",
    " * We will apply our model to the entire train set available to us and scale up the training a bit more\n",
    " * We will discuss some of the effects of overfitting on our model\n",
    " * This section will contain a set of resources and extension"
